## Initial

This folder covers going from the original bag files and bag file viewer to an updated version dealing with the colour stream correctly for OpenCV and trialing the RealSense Python Wrapper Examples.

This folder also is a good place to start to make sure the Repo is setup and the camera is working with a test script that streams the RGB, Depth and 2 IR camera streams.

Further details available in the README.md in this folder
