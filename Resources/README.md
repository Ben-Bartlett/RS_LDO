## Original Material

This folder contains:
  - link_to_thesis.txt
    - which as it states, is a link to the thesis provided as a stating point for the work that was completed in this project.
  - open_bags(origianal).py
    - which as it states, was code provided to playback bag files that were also provided.
  - download_bags.sh
    - which as it states, is a script to allow you to download the bag files provided at the start of the project. (to be added)

## Papers

This folder contains:
  - research_papers_links.csv
    - which as it states, is a csv file with all research paper titles and links to the papers that I "read" during the literature review.
    - This CSV is __;__ seperated so more of a SCSV file. When opening make sure to choose seperated by __;__. This file was generated after the fact using a script to allow me to open all pdf files I downloaded during the literature review and find their links on google scholar. Thus compiling a useable list. 
    - This list has some themes if you read the papers in order as I grouped the papers into two main folders, Segmentation and Deformable Object tracking like the presentations but there were also sub folders such as CNN, Cables, Lane Tracking, Non-Rigid Object Tracking, RGBD and so on as discussed in the presentations. 
    - I did not link the actual pdfs due to download rights.
    - This list may be slightly imperfect with regards to the names/links and to note: not all files are relevant. The more relevant ones are discussed in the presentations. 

## Presentations

This folder contains:
  - State of the Art_Segmentation.pdf
  - State of the Art_Deformable_Mapping.pdf

These were completed in this order. They reference by name, many of the papers in the csv file which is in the Papers folder. These wont win any awards for powerpoint design but they encompass the areas relatively well and were good practice for future work as a good starting point, as this is not something I have typically done. Usually do; then review.  

## Reports

May add a report to summarise the REPO but we will see. 
 
## Links

May add a file linking random things that were found or things that may be useful to look at.
